I plan to collect a recent dataset on loan customers from Lending Club through web-scraping. 

The problem Iâ€™m trying to solve is loan pricing strategy. On the basis of the customer data I plan to determine the optimal yield i.e. the buy rate for the auto loan with a focus on risk management and considering additional factors such as customer value addition and customer loyalty. 

Usually in order to determine the buy rate, just the customer credentials like income, credit-score, credit history etc. are taken into consideration. But these factors have a lag and usually takes time to be updated. I would try to look at other factors , like the customer's entire relationship with the institution ( considering his total assets & liabilities with the institution) in order to determine the optimal buy rate. 

I plan to start by getting an initial glimpse into the loan dataset. Then I plan to do some exploratory data analysis. Then I plan to use supervised learning,i.e., the different regression techniques to determine the optimal buy rate on the basis of the features. I would use different metrics to see which regression model is most accurately able to predict the buy rate. I also plan to use unsupervised learning techniques K-Means Clustering/ Hierarchical Clustering/DBScan  to segregate the loan customers based on similar characteristics. Then would use different metrics like Silhouette score etc. to determine the most optimal clustering technique.

The biggest challenge that I anticipate facing is getting an appropriate dataset that would help me to successfully accomplish the pricing tasks that I have mentioned above.
